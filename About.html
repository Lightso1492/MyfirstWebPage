          <p1>Design life began with drawing, inking and colorizing comic book imagery the old-fashioned way. Long after, into to my college days I looked for inspiration in many other art forms, such as music, sculpture, and carpentry. College brought more than just my BA in visual design but ways to explore other artistic venues – everything from traditional cel animation to metalsmithing. I look for inspiration and creative outlets in everything.</p1>

          <p1>Post-college, I delved right into digital photographic alteration for a photo-lab company and a few short years later started my own graphics and printing business using that previous digital photography experience but also utilizing my graphic design training and illustration background for clients throughout Oregon.</p1>

          <p1>Still doing contracted work on the side, I took on a contract with an interactive kiosk company in Maryland and worked remotely for them for 9 years. This was at a time when user interface design was still figuring out what it could be, and although through this company I handled interactive design for many major companies throughout the U.S. (Hersheys, Bank of America, McCormicks, Jamba Juice, just to name a few) they had a hard time keeping up with the emerging technology around UX/UI these companies began to demand.</p1>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p1>Feeling a bit behind the times, I took on a UX/UI bootcamp and earned my certification. I will always be looking to dabble in the most current emerging design technologies, and my previous design foundation will always stay relevant to wherever the industry travels to next.</p1>
